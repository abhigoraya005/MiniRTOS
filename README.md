# 📌 Project Overview

Real-Time Operating Systems are fundamental to modern embedded systems, automotive ECUs, IoT devices, robotics, industrial controllers, and real-time applications.

MiniRTOS is being developed as a learning-oriented systems project to understand how fundamental RTOS mechanisms operate internally.

Instead of relying directly on an existing RTOS such as FreeRTOS, this project explores the implementation of core RTOS concepts from scratch using the C programming language.

The project currently demonstrates:

- MiniRTOS kernel initialization
- Task Control Blocks (TCBs)
- Task creation
- Dynamic task registration
- Task identification
- Task priorities
- Task state representation
- Task table visualization
- Cooperative Round-Robin scheduling
- READY task selection
- Automatic skipping of unavailable tasks
- Multi-task execution simulation

The current implementation runs as a **host-side simulation using GCC** while maintaining a modular architecture designed around embedded RTOS concepts.

# ✨ Current Features

## ⚙️ Kernel Initialization

The MiniRTOS kernel provides a centralized initialization mechanism for starting the simulated operating system environment.

Example output:

```text
=================================
       MiniRTOS Kernel v0.1
=================================
[KERNEL] Initializing MiniRTOS...
[KERNEL] Kernel initialized successfully.
```

The kernel initialization layer serves as the foundation for additional RTOS components.

---

# 🧠 Task Control Block

MiniRTOS implements a Task Control Block structure for representing individual tasks.

Each task contains information such as:

```text
Task ID
Task Name
Priority
Task State
Task Function
Stack Pointer
```

The TCB architecture provides the foundation for task management and scheduling.

---

# 🚦 Task States

MiniRTOS defines multiple task states to represent the lifecycle of a task.

Supported task states include:

```text
READY
RUNNING
BLOCKED
SUSPENDED
```

At the current development stage, the scheduler primarily operates on tasks in the `READY` state.

Future development will extend state transitions through blocking, suspension, delays, and synchronization mechanisms.

---

# 📝 Dynamic Task Registration

MiniRTOS supports dynamic registration of application tasks with the Task Manager.

Example tasks:

```text
Sensor
Processing
Logger
Idle
```

Each task is registered with:

```text
Task Name
Task Function
Priority
```

Example:

```c
MiniRTOS_CreateTask(
    "Sensor",
    SensorTask,
    3
);

MiniRTOS_CreateTask(
    "Processing",
    ProcessingTask,
    2
);

MiniRTOS_CreateTask(
    "Logger",
    LoggerTask,
    1
);

MiniRTOS_CreateTask(
    "Idle",
    IdleTask,
    0
);
```

The Task Manager automatically assigns each task a unique Task ID.

---

# 📋 Task Table

MiniRTOS can display information about all registered tasks.

Example:

```text
=================================
       MiniRTOS Task Table
=================================
---------------------------------
Task ID       : 1
Task Name     : Sensor
Priority      : 3
State         : READY
Stack Pointer : 0000000000000000
---------------------------------
Task ID       : 2
Task Name     : Processing
Priority      : 2
State         : READY
Stack Pointer : 0000000000000000
---------------------------------
Task ID       : 3
Task Name     : Logger
Priority      : 1
State         : READY
Stack Pointer : 0000000000000000
---------------------------------
Task ID       : 4
Task Name     : Idle
Priority      : 0
State         : READY
Stack Pointer : 0000000000000000
---------------------------------
Total Tasks: 4 / 8
=================================
```

The task table provides visibility into the current state of the MiniRTOS task system.

---

# 🔁 Round-Robin Scheduler

Day 4 introduces the first scheduling algorithm in MiniRTOS.

The current scheduler uses a cooperative **Round-Robin scheduling policy**.

Tasks are selected sequentially:

```text
Sensor
   │
   ▼
Processing
   │
   ▼
Logger
   │
   ▼
Idle
   │
   ▼
Sensor
```

After reaching the final task, the scheduler returns to the first eligible task.

---

## Scheduler Execution

A scheduler cycle performs the following operations:

```text
Scheduler Cycle
      │
      ▼
Find Next Task
      │
      ▼
Check Task State
      │
      ├── Not READY ──► Skip Task
      │
      ▼
Task READY
      │
      ▼
Mark RUNNING
      │
      ▼
Execute Task Function
      │
      ▼
Return Task to READY
```

This provides a basic cooperative task scheduling simulation.

---

## READY Task Selection

The scheduler only executes tasks that are currently in the `READY` state.

Tasks in other states can be skipped.

Conceptually:

```text
Task 1: Sensor       READY       → Execute
Task 2: Processing   READY       → Execute
Task 3: Logger       BLOCKED     → Skip
Task 4: Idle         READY       → Execute
```

This provides the foundation for future task blocking, delays, synchronization, and IPC mechanisms.

---

# 🧪 Current Demo Application

The MiniRTOS demo application currently contains four simulated tasks.

## Sensor Task

```text
[TASK] Reading simulated sensor data.
```

Represents a task responsible for collecting data from a simulated sensor.

---

## Processing Task

```text
[TASK] Processing simulated data.
```

Represents a task responsible for processing sensor information.

---

## Logger Task

```text
[TASK] Logging system information.
```

Represents a task responsible for recording system information.

---

## Idle Task

```text
[TASK] CPU Idle.
```

Represents an idle execution path when no higher-level application work is required.

---

# 🔄 Current Task Execution Flow

The current MiniRTOS application follows this simulated execution sequence:

```text

    Sensor      Processing     Logger
       │            │            │
       └────────────┼────────────┘
                    │
                    ▼
                   Idle
                    │
                    ▼
              Repeat Cycle
```

# ⚠️ Current Limitations

MiniRTOS is currently an educational **host-side RTOS kernel simulation**.

At the current Day 4 development stage, it does not yet implement:

- Hardware-based context switching
- ARM Cortex-M register save/restore
- PendSV-based context switching
- Hardware SysTick interrupts
- Preemptive multitasking
- Per-task hardware stacks
- Semaphore synchronization
- Mutex synchronization
- Message queues
- Hardware interrupt handling
- Priority inheritance
- Dynamic memory management

The current scheduler is a cooperative host-side simulation intended to demonstrate fundamental task scheduling concepts.

---

# 🚀 Future Embedded Port

After completing the host-side implementation, MiniRTOS could be extended to run on an ARM Cortex-M microcontroller.

A potential target is:

```text
STM32F103C8T6
ARM Cortex-M3
```

A future hardware port could implement:

```text
Hardware SysTick
      │
      ▼
Scheduler Trigger
      │
      ▼
PendSV Exception
      │
      ▼
Save Current Context
      │
      ▼
Select Next Task
      │
      ▼
Restore Next Context
```

This would transform the current educational scheduler simulation into a more hardware-oriented RTOS implementation.

---

# 🎯 Learning Outcomes

Through the first four development stages, the following concepts have been explored:

- RTOS kernel architecture
- Modular C project organization
- Task Control Blocks
- Task representation
- Task lifecycle concepts
- Dynamic task registration
- Task function pointers
- Task priorities
- Task state representation
- Cooperative scheduling
- Round-Robin scheduling
- Scheduler task selection
- Embedded software abstraction
- GCC-based C development

Future development will expand these learning outcomes into synchronization, inter-task communication, system timing, and context management.

---

# 📌 Technical Note

MiniRTOS is designed as an educational implementation for understanding RTOS internals.

The current version is a **host-side simulation compiled using GCC**. It demonstrates the logical architecture of task management and scheduling but does not currently perform hardware-level context switching on an ARM Cortex-M processor.

Future development stages will introduce additional RTOS concepts while maintaining a modular architecture suitable for exploring a potential Cortex-M port.
